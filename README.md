# UATanks

UATanks is a top-down tank shooting game, where your goal is to control a tank in an arena and destroy all the other tanks to win. It is one of the larger projects I have made during college, and is used to demonstrate features such as:
- Having each tank have a different "personality", by giving each type of a tank a different AI
- An options menu for changing key settings for the game
- Having a multitude of different powerups and effects
- A mini-map for knowing where everything is located
- A map that is procedurally generated
- Splitscreen multiplayer
- A highscore system
- Saving option settings to disk via PlayerPrefs
