There are 4 different personalities that an AI enemy can be in:

Chase : Will simply chase towards the player

Flee : Will simply flee from the player

Patrol : Patrols a set region defined by waypoints. 
         If it can hear the player, it will stop and rotate towards the player
         If it can see the player, it will rotate towards him
         If the player is directly within the enemy's line of sight, it will stop rotating and will start shooting at the player
